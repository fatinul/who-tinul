### üöÄ How it all started?

Its been a year since the last time that I used Windows. In the beginning, I just watched this youtube video below, but then something click inside me.

[![youtube video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/pAn4YeeifLY/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn4YeeifLY)

Before the transition, I thought "What could go worse?" (**foreshadow: a lot!**) and how I feel like it would benefit in a long run as I have used Linux on VM (since I am SW student), and it was fun and intuitive enough.

Firstly (*as everything that I do*), I watched some youtube videos on which Linux distro that work the best and suitable for me. Haha, as I underestimate those videos, I tried to install (*the scariest, the craziest, and the most not-so-beginner-distro*) [Arch](https://archlinux.org/). Let me tell you, it was not the best experience.

Then, I found the one and only, [Pop!_OS](https://system76.com/pop/?srsltid=AfmBOor4_xU6s4Dc3Q2rhwNCFLYKj0C3rkoSS17D37LVZwDY8hfRriMK), which is Ubuntu-based distro that support NVIDIA GPU (which my laptop have NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Laptop)[^1] out-of-the-box and pretty simple and straightforward distro. I stayed using Pop!_OS until the current date of my blog, in which I change to Windows (*sadly*) due to my multimedia side quest (*why Adobe .. why*). **BUT** I learned a lot during the process and gratefully thank you for doing so!

[^1]: Arch as we already know is not for beginner hence the need to set up the distro from scratch is like asking a preschool children to solve quantum physics equation (aka **IMPOSSIBLE**), and also NVIDIA (at least 1 year ago) is not that fully supported yet.

### What I learned during that 1 year?

#### 1. üíª Improve my understanding and interest on Computer

The interesting part of using Linux, is actually using Linux (lol, i know right). **Fun Fact**: Before you can even install any linux distro, you would need a pendrive to flash the distro[^2]. For newcomers, it is like a test of champion, where you would need to follow youtube's tutorial for every little step without fail even once. I still remembered on how I feel after I saw the green command output of success (the relief feeling that just couldn't be replicated in my life forever) After that, the Linux hastle and excitement just got started.

[^2]: For newcomers (like me 1 year ago), you would need [Balena Etcher](https://etcher.balena.io/) or [rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/) to create a bootable USB drives.

One of the best feeling when using Linux is have the fullpower (full control) over your laptop in any case without any boundary and the power relies on the terminal. It might be scary for the first time, but as too simple or tacky it looks, it certainly much powerful and hold crazy possibilities that you could ever imagine a simple laptop can do (at least something that a laptop can do, and not make a coffee for you haha (okay lets move on)). The exploration of the terminal had actually brought me to create my own **Terminal User Interface (TUI)** that called "[the-mee-null](../../projects/the-mee-null)"

#### 2. üîì The Vast World of OPEN SOURCE 

Before I transition (to Linux), I don't even know how freedom feels like. The possibility for you to just simply install any (most of the) program for free on linux is just immaculate. The fact that I don't even know any of these applications before I move to Linux is expected as we are blind by big corporate. Apps like [kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org/), [Krita](https://krita.org/en/), [VLC Media Player](https://images.videolan.org/vlc/) [^3] and more!

[^3]: Yeah the OG himself, the VLC is actually an open source apps in which it was completely free and no paid walls block any features. 

As one of the open source communities famous site: Github. It makes me have a need to get familiar with the git workflow. And you know what, after (finally) understand its use cases, it makes much more confident on its usability without have a need to comment the line of code in which cluttered the whole screen with useless junk. Having git is like having a superman holding your hand and tell you "You can do whatever you want, if its broken don't worry I can fly back time to reverse your consequences"

Not to mention, but there are countless amount of community project that are super niche but is extremely helpful either in your learning, day-to-day usecases or just for a funsies.

#### 3. ü§ñ How easy it is for programmers

I am a software student, of course I know that people either choose either Mac or Linux to be their main platform to code but I did not know that it was so good to this extent! It was super easy to install any command/utils as you can simply use *package manager*[^4]

[^4]: A **package manager** or **package management system** is a collection of software tools that automates the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing computer programs for a computer in a consistent manner. -[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager)-

Surprisingly most of the things that you would need to do on windows is as easy as just 1 line command, compared to the need of surviving the challenges of pop up ads attacks that comes at you like in the Elden Ring! No ads, no hustle just one line of command in the terminal, and your app will be installed directly into your laptop (How Convenient!).

To summarize, these are just the tip of the iceberg that Linux is capable and benefit me as a software student. There are a lot more things that I want to share regarding my experience but I think this sums my whole experience with Linux in the last year. I really grateful that I make the decision to try dive straight into Linux, and fortunately I survived and I will switch to Linux again in the near future after I have another laptop in which I can tinker it as much as I want!

Thank you for your reading.
